# server-info-scripts

This project provides a collection of Linux shell scripts to gather and display essential server information, including CPU usage, memory stats, disk usage, network details, and uptime. Ideal for system admins and DevOps engineers to automate server health checks and reporting tasks.

üîç Project Scope

This project focuses on developing a Linux shell script that automates the retrieval and display of essential server information. It gathers system data such as logged-in user details, system uptime, memory and disk usage, CPU performance, login history, and active processes. The script is designed to assist system administrators, DevOps professionals, and IT students in monitoring system health through a command-line interface, reducing manual effort and increasing visibility.

üìò General Description

The Linux Server Information Shell Scripting Project helps you automate routine server health checks using Bash. This project includes scripts that collect real-time data such as:

Current logged-in user (whoami)

Server date and time (date)

System uptime (uptime)

Previous login attempts (last)

Disk usage (df -h)

RAM usage (free -h)

Top CPU-consuming processes (top)

IP addresses and host details

Along the way, you'll learn how to:

Write and execute bash scripts

Use variables, escape sequences, and system commands

Format and beautify terminal output

Perform real-time server monitoring

Combine and filter command outputs using tools like awk, xargs, and echo

‚úÖ What You‚Äôll Learn

Basics of shell scripting in Linux

Practical use of system monitoring commands

Script formatting, user-friendly output design

Handling system information and logs

Automating routine server management tasks

Using conditional logic and command chaining in Bash
